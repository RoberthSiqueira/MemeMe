# MemeMe
nanodegree's project from Udacity

The project's concept allows users to choose on library or take a photo then add a top and a bottom text creating a fantastic meme. After the meme could be shared on social media or saved in the library.

## View Code

I am more comfortable using code to create the app's UI instead Interface Builder tools. The lessons use Storyboard. 
Since I used view code in a big project with different developers it is my favorite way because focusing on maintenance and readable statements, in my opinion, is better.
